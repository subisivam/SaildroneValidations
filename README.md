average-sd: averages saildrone data (run this before running interp code)

interp-to-m2: produces paired saildrone and MERRA2 data (make sure you set the dates and missing value number correctly)

interp-to-e5: produces paired saildrone and ERA5 data (make sure you set the dates and missing value number correctly)

interp-to-c2: produces paired saildrone and CFSR2 data (make sure you set the dates and missing value number correctly)

grapher1/grapher2: prepares data and produces different plots 

check-land: gets land coordinates for MERRA2, ERA5, and CFSR2 datasets (run this before running interp code)

var-calculations: calculation of specific humidity variables for saildrones
